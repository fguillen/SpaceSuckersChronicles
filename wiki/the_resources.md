# The Resources

Are the _raw materia_ for **build, upgrade and repair** _ships_.

_The Resources_ are find in the _planets_. Each planet has characteristic amount of each resource **you can extract by day**. 

## Types

Only 1 type (more in the future):

* **Gum Materia**

## Harvest

Only _Mine_ ship can harvest resources.

The _harvest_ power of a mine represents the amount of total resources it can harvest in a day.

_Mine_ ship belongs to a planet an it has **velocity == 0** so it can't be moved for there.

## The Warehouse

Each planet has an unlimited warehouse capacity, but this warehouse is static and only _fleets_ standby in this planet can use this _resources_.

You can use _Warehouse_ ships to move _resources_ from a planet to another.

## The Market

You can send _resources_ from your planet to an **enemy planet**.
