# The Map

We need anyway to define the position of the planets in our universe.

I think a **2D universe** is enough for us.

Could be great to be able to define the universe map with in a plain text mode like:

           *        *
                    
                          *  *
        *       *
        

Where the _'*'_ are planets perfectly localized in our 2D universe.

## Distances

Each character in the plain text map represent a distance unit, we can call it **'Step'**.
